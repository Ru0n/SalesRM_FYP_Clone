# 🎉 CLONING ISSUE FIXED!

## ✅ PROBLEM RESOLVED

The cloning issue with multiple branches has been **COMPLETELY FIXED**!

### 🔍 What Was Wrong:
- Repository had two branches: `master` and `main`
- `main` branch only had partial content (missing expenses, leaves, reports, tours, etc.)
- `master` branch had complete content but was missing analytics functionality
- Users were getting confused about which branch to clone

### ✅ What's Fixed Now:
- **`master` branch now contains EVERYTHING**:
  - ✅ Complete backend with all modules (expenses, leaves, reports, tours, analytics, etc.)
  - ✅ Complete frontend with all components
  - ✅ Working analytics functionality
  - ✅ All API endpoints functional
  - ✅ Proper URL routing and Django configuration

## 🚀 CORRECT CLONING INSTRUCTIONS

### ✅ Method 1: Direct Clone (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/Ru0n/SalesRM_FYP_Clone.git
cd SalesRM_FYP_Clone
```

### ✅ Method 2: Using Fix Script
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ru0n/SalesRM_FYP_Clone/main/SIMPLE_CLONE_FIX.sh

```

### ✅ Verification Commands
```bash
